add 'value=""' to option 'please select' in addPhoto.php
set option 'date' to data type calender globally
set option value (corresponding to id in each db table) starting from 1
use functions like date() and strtotime() of php to format date string transported from the frontend
redis is not only for the cache of options there, but also for that of sql records
